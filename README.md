⭐ My work isn't done until your product performs beautifully and profitably. I help startups and businesses transforming ideas into fast, scalable, and growth-ready web & mobile apps powered by AI and automation. Every line of code I write aims to simplify your operations, boost conversions, and scale your revenue.

I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and AI Automation Expert. I help startups and businesses build high quality web apps, APIs, and AI-powered workflows that save time and maximize growth.

And over the past 4+ years, I have built 100+ web & mobile solutions using React, Next.js, Node.js, and TypeScript with completely backend integration, database optimization, and automation pipelines with full DevOps.

⦿ What I Do Best:

✔ Full Stack Development: MERN Stack, Next.js, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Prisma, Wordpress
✔ Mobile Apps: React Native (iOS & Android), Redux, Expo, Firebase, API Integrations
✔ Automation Flows: Zapier, n8n, API integrations, AI workflows (voiceover, video generation, affirmation content flows)
✔ AI Integration: OpenAI API, AI-powered features, custom API development
✔ Optimization: Performance tuning, code refactoring, bug fixing, deployment (Vercel, Render, AWS, Digital Ocean)

⦿ Why Clients Love Working With Me:
✔ Launch MVPs up to 5x faster than traditional dev cycles
✔ Clear communication & daily updates
✔ End-to-end service from idea to production
✔ Support even after project delivery

Some Wins:

✔ Built & automated AI content creation pipelines for Rehabit.us (video, audio, voiceover generation)
✔ Created custom automation flows for HidayahSoft with Zapier & n8n
✔ Delivered multiple Full Stack Development & MERN stack web apps from concept to deployment in weeks, not months

If you need a developer who's also a problem-solver, automation builder, and speed optimizer, I am here to make it happen.
